This folder contains experimental results in the form of MAP configurations for datasets used in the paper: ....

The naming scheme is as follows: networkname + Model variant + Motif set + lad (the isomorphism algorithm)

Model variants: A: total degree model, O:orbit degree model, NO: motif degree model, DAS: directed degree model, H: homogenous/nonDC model 

Motif sets: D5: directed motifs upto size 5, U8: Undirected motifs upto size 8. 

e.g. celegansneuralAD5lad : MAP configuration of celegansneural, total degree model, directed motifs upto size 5. 

The 'Meta' folder contains results for metabolic networks. 


The 'Meta' folder contains results for metabolic networks. 

The 'PPI-TOL' folder contains results for PPI networks. 

The folders 'DirectedConnectomes' and 'UndirectedConnectomes' contain results for human connectomes.
